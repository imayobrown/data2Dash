Web application using Django Framework to serve data sets in various formats from a database to a web page in a human readable format.

The current plan is to use Django to create a application that serves previously saved data in an XML format from a MySQL database to an aesthetically pleasing web browser dashboard. Extensions to data presentation and dynamic formating will be made once basic functionality has been established.
